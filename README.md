# GameTCP + GameTCP2
WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE: Some stuff that I put together to attempt to help with online gaming in Windows 10. It's far from complete, but I don't have the time to complete it at the moment. I Will try soon, hopefully very soon. I'm making this available for anyone else to tinker with. The "status" of "current" and "new" are messed up I know. GameTCP2 was supposed to be the "newer" but I've used GameTCP instead.

I should also mention that I actually use a celluar connecetion (LTE/5G) so it's not easy to test this as it would be on a fiber connection or cable, etc. I am also releasing this ona BSD-v3 license, which all needs to be updated accordingly. This is a slow moving project.
