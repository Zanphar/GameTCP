WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE: Some stuff that I put together to attempt to help with online gaming with Windows 10. It's far from complete, but I don't have the time to complete it at the moment. Will try soon, hopefully very soon. I'm making this available for anyone else to tinker with. The "status" of "current" and "new" are messed up I know.
